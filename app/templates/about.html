    <h1>How does it work?</h1>
        <p>Tell us where you want to start your ride and we'll create a circular route ending back at the same place.</p>
        <p>With RideTime, all routes are circular - so they start and finish in the same location.</p>
        <p>Perfect for planning rides with friends, riding solo, weekend rides or after-work exercise.</p>
        <p>It's totally free to use. Ready to <a href="{{ url_for('start_page') }}">get started</a>?</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Do I need an account?</h1>
        <p>No, you can get started with route planning straight away, no need to sign up.</p>
        <p>If you want to though, you can use an account to save routes and come back and view them again later.</p>
