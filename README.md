# RideTime - route planning for cyclists

RideTime is a website for creating circular road cycling routes in the UK.

Built in Python, using Flask framework.

It makes use of external services including Mapbox (OpenStreetMap) and OpenRouteService.

Users can create a route from their preferred start location, and preferred distance (5-100km).
Routes can then be viewed online, and downloaded in GPX format for navigation with GPS devices from Wahoo, Garmin, etc. devices.

The site can be used without signing up, however with a free account users can save routes and also publish them to share with friends.
